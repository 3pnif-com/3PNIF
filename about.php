    			<br><br><strong>What is 3PNIF?</strong><br>
    			Is a framework for free use.<br>
    			3PNIF helps to carry out a risk assessment of information and systems security by performing tests containing the selected tools for information and identification of vulnerabilities or security breaches. This risk assessment presents results or information through the output of the tools, which allow to identify if they are in agreement with those expected or planned previously.
