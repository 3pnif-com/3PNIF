What is 3PNIF?
Is a framework for free use.
3PNIF helps to carry out a risk assessment of information and systems security by performing tests containing the selected tools for information and identification of vulnerabilities or security breaches. This risk assessment presents results or information through the output of the tools, which allow to identify if they are in agreement with those expected or planned previously.

3PNIF Instalation
-----------------

Installing 3PNIF framework is a simple process. As this is a Web application, all of its content is portable.

It's possible to access the framework execution files through two sites:
1) http://www.3pnif.com/3pnif-full.zip - Full-file compressed file (Apache, PHP, MySQL, phpMyAdmin, all necessary tools and installation requirements) through the official page;
2) https://github.com/3pnif-com/3pnif - Access to the Git Hub where the framework that corresponds to the web folder of the project (www) is located and then it is necessary to download all the necessary applications to execute the 3PNIF, available at http://www.3pnif.com/3pnif-core.zip.

In the first case, the process is much simpler, just download the compressed file and unzip to a Windows OS folder.

As for the second case, the process goes through the following steps:
1) Download the Git Hub files (www folder);
2) Download the necessary files on the official website;
3) Place the unloaded www folder in 1) into the folder discharged in 2).

To run the platform, open the file "3PNIF.bat", where the credentials for access are requested:
1) Username: user
2) Password: resu

As an alternative to running the "3PNIF.bat" file, you can use the "UniController.exe" file which contains several procedures related to the Apache service, for management of the whole platform, including "Start MySQL" and "Start Apache".
